    Represents a Cellular Automata Machine (CAM).

    The CAM consists of any number of bit planes that allow for increasingly complex cellular automata.
    This is the top-level module that should be used by anyone wanting to work with fifth, and provides
    all methods needed (i.e. supported) to interact/configure the cellular automata as desired.
