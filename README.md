(CAM) Fifth
===========

The following is a Cellular Automata Machine (CAM) library loosely based off the CAM Forth language as described
in "Cellular Automata Machines" by Toffoli and Margolus. I wanted to be able to follow along in the book but,
though mentioned as reasonably priced, a CAM Forth machine is out of my price range.

The following uses numpy/scipy underneath, and will ideally incorporate the following:

* Arbitrary description of neighborhoods
* Arbitrary leveling of bit planes
* Arbitrary description of rulesets
* 2D and 3D cellular automata
* Timing specifications for granular viewing
* Echoing and Tracing (for 2D)
